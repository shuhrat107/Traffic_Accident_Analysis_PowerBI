# Traffic Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI Project)

## Overview
This Power BI project presents a multi-layered analysis of traffic accident data. The goal is to uncover patterns, assess contributing factors, and provide actionable insights for improving road safety and traffic management. The report is spread over 6 themed pages, each addressing a specific analytical dimension.

## Report Pages & Purpose

1. **Traffic Accident Overview**  
   - Summary statistics on total accidents, types, severity, and time-based trends.

2. **Traffic Congestion Monitoring**  
   - Visuals exploring accident frequency in high-traffic periods and locations.

3. **Geographic Risk Analysis**  
   - Map-based insights identifying high-risk zones and accident-prone intersections.

4. **Probability Analysis**  
   - Predictive modeling showing the likelihood of accidents by conditions (e.g. weather, time of day, vehicle type).

5. **Root Cause Analysis**  
   - Breakdown of key contributing factors such as human error, infrastructure issues, or environmental elements.

6. **Recommendations & Monitoring**  
   - Suggested policy measures and a monitoring framework using KPIs and trend indicators.
